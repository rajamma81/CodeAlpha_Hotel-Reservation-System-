# CodeAlpha_Hotel-Reservation-System-

This image shows the interface of a hotel booking website. It features a navbar at the top with menu options, including Home, Room & Facilities, Online Reservation, and Admin. The logo displays "hotel Booking" with an icon resembling a roof or a house, which complements the theme of a hotel booking site.

The main content area shows an image of a luxurious hotel lobby with elegant decor, featuring comfortable seating, a chandelier, and a reception area. This image likely serves as an aesthetic visual on the homepage to give visitors a welcoming first impression of the hotel. Additionally, social media icons are displayed on the top-right corner, which may link to the hotel's social media pages.

This design aligns with typical hospitality websites by presenting a professional and inviting look that emphasizes comfort and elegance. It looks like this page is part of the hotel reservation system you're working on.
